# Introduction   

This project focuses on building a web application with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities using Flask and Streamlit. Provides an efficient interface for managing data, enhancing user interactions with a structured database.

# Domain: ðŸ“Š Data Management

# Skills Takeaway     

Web development, CRUD operations, Flask API development, Data handling with MySQL, Streamlit UI design.      

# Overview   

# API and Backend Development:   

Sets up a backend API using Flask for data management. Defines CRUD endpoints to handle data interactions such as creation, retrieval, updates, and deletion of records.   

# Data Storage:   
 
Configures a MySQL database to store records. Designs database schema for structured storage of data fields like user details, roles, and other related information.   

# User Interface with Streamlit:   

Develops a Streamlit interface to provide a user-friendly frontend for CRUD operations. Implements forms, tables, and visual feedback for enhanced user interaction with data.   

# Technology and Tools   

-> Flask (Backend API)      
-> MySQL (Database)   
-> Streamlit (Frontend UI)   
-> Python (Scripting and Logic)   
-> SQLAlchemy (ORM for MySQL)   


# Packages and Libraries

# Features   

# Data Management:   

Allows users to perform CRUD operations on data through the Streamlit UI. Facilitates dynamic querying and updates via Flask endpoints.

# Database Storage:   

Data is stored in a MySQL database, ensuring structured and reliable data management. Optimized SQL queries are used for efficient data manipulation and retrieval.   

# User Interaction:   

Enables users to enter data in forms and view, update, or delete records directly from the Streamlit application. Displays visual confirmations for successful data transactions.    

# Usage   

Enter details in the form fields provided in the Streamlit application. Click buttons to Create, Read, Update, or Delete records from the MySQL database through the Flask API.
